Langton's ant is a two-dimensional cellular automaton that 
follows a simple set of rules. The ant moves on a grid of 
cells, each of which can be in one of two states: black or 
white. At each step, the ant looks at the color of the cell
it is currently on, and then performs the following actions:

If the cell is white, the ant turns 90 degrees to the right 
and changes the color of the cell to black.

If the cell is black, the ant turns 90 degrees to the left 
and changes the color of the cell to white.
